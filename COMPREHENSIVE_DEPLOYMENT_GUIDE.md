| Staging | Render | SQLite | Pre-production testing | Free tier |
| Production | AWS | PostgreSQL | Live production system | Optimized |

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture

The platform follows a modular architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend      │    │   API Gateway   │    │   AI Services   │
│   (Future)      │◄──►│   Flask App     │◄──►│   OpenAI/Google │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                       ┌─────────────────┐
                       │   Database      │
                       │   SQLite/PG     │
                       └─────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Component Architecture

The application is structured using Flask blueprints for modular organization:

- **Dynamic Pricing Module**: Handles pricing calculations and market analysis
- **KaAni Integration Module**: Manages AI-powered agricultural diagnosis
- **Logistics Module**: Coordinates delivery and pickup services
- **Authentication Module**: Manages user access and security
- **Analytics Module**: Provides insights and reporting capabilities

### 2.3 Data Flow

The platform processes data through several key workflows:

1. **User Request Processing**: Incoming API requests are routed through Flask blueprints
2. **AI Processing**: Agricultural queries are processed through OpenAI or Google AI
3. **Database Operations**: Data persistence and retrieval through SQLAlchemy ORM
4. **Response Generation**: Structured JSON responses with comprehensive error handling

## 3. Development Environment Setup

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Before setting up the development environment, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

**System Requirements:**
- Python 3.9 or higher (3.11 recommended)
- Git version control system
- Internet connection for package installation
- Minimum 4GB RAM and 10GB disk space

**API Keys (Optional for Development):**
- OpenAI API key for AI features
- Google AI API key for comparison testing

### 3.2 Automated Setup

The platform includes an automated setup script that configures the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd magsasa-backend-clean

# Run automated setup
./deployment/scripts/setup-environment.sh development
```

The setup script performs the following operations:

1. **Environment Validation**: Checks Python version and required tools
2. **Virtual Environment Creation**: Sets up isolated Python environment
3. **Dependency Installation**: Installs all required packages from requirements.txt
4. **Database Initialization**: Creates and populates the SQLite database
5. **Configuration Setup**: Copies environment variables and configuration files
6. **Testing**: Runs basic application tests to verify setup

### 3.3 Manual Setup Process

For environments where the automated script cannot be used, follow these manual steps:

**Step 1: Virtual Environment Setup**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements_production.txt
```

**Step 3: Environment Configuration**
```bash
cp deployment/configs/.env.development .env
# Edit .env file to add your API keys if available
```

**Step 4: Database Initialization**
```bash
python create_dynamic_pricing_db.py
```

**Step 5: Application Testing**
```bash
python app_production.py
# Test at http://localhost:5000/health
```

### 3.4 Development Workflow

The recommended development workflow follows these practices:

**Code Development:**
1. Create feature branches from the main branch
2. Implement changes with comprehensive testing
3. Run local tests before committing
4. Use the pre-commit hooks for code quality

**Testing Process:**
1. Unit testing for individual components
2. Integration testing for API endpoints
3. End-to-end testing for complete workflows
4. Performance testing for optimization

**Deployment Process:**
1. Merge approved changes to main branch
2. Automated testing in staging environment
3. Manual verification of staging deployment
4. Production deployment after approval

## 4. Staging Deployment (Render)

### 4.1 Render Platform Overview

Render provides a simple and cost-effective platform for staging deployments with the following advantages:

- **Free Tier**: Sufficient for staging environments with 750 hours per month
- **Automatic Deployments**: Git-based deployments with zero configuration
- **SSL Certificates**: Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage and management of configuration
- **Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring and automatic restarts

### 4.2 Deployment Configuration

The platform includes a comprehensive Render configuration file at `deployment/render/render.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: magsasa-card-api-staging
    env: python
    plan: starter
    buildCommand: |
      pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install -r requirements_production.txt
    startCommand: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app_production:app --workers 2 --timeout 120
```

### 4.3 Automated Deployment Process

The deployment process is automated through the provided script:

```bash
./deployment/scripts/deploy-to-render.sh
```

**Deployment Steps:**
1. **Prerequisites Check**: Validates Git repository and configuration files
2. **Code Validation**: Tests application startup and basic functionality
3. **Git Operations**: Commits changes and pushes to repository
4. **Render Deployment**: Triggers automatic deployment through Git integration
5. **Verification**: Monitors deployment status and performs health checks

### 4.4 Environment Configuration

The staging environment requires specific environment variables to be configured in the Render dashboard:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | staging | Deployment environment identifier |
| `FLASK_ENV` | production | Flask environment mode |
| `DATABASE_TYPE` | sqlite | Database type for staging |

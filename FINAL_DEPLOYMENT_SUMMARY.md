## üîß Current Issue Analysis

### Blueprint Registration Issue

The deployment shows that the main application is running (root endpoint works), but individual blueprint endpoints return 404 errors. This indicates a blueprint import or registration issue in the deployed environment.

**Possible Causes**
1. **Import Path Issues**: Blueprint imports may fail due to Python path configuration
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Some required packages might not be installed in deployment
3. **File Structure**: Blueprint files might not be properly copied to deployment
4. **Environment Differences**: Local vs. deployment environment configuration differences

**Evidence**
- ‚úÖ Root endpoint (`/`) works and returns comprehensive API documentation
- ‚ùå Blueprint endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/pricing/health`) return 404 errors
- ‚úÖ Application starts without errors (no 500 errors)
- ‚úÖ All blueprint files exist and are properly implemented

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Deployment Logs**
   - Review application startup logs for blueprint registration messages
   - Look for import errors or missing dependency warnings
   - Verify all blueprint files are present in deployment

2. **Verify File Structure**
   - Ensure `src/routes/` directory and all blueprint files are deployed
   - Check that `__init__.py` files exist for proper Python module structure
   - Verify import paths are correct for deployment environment

3. **Test Blueprint Registration**
   - Add debug logging to show which blueprints are successfully registered
   - Create a simple test endpoint to verify blueprint functionality
   - Check Flask application context and blueprint registration order

### Alternative Deployment Options

**Option 1: Render Platform**
- Use the existing `render.yaml` configuration
- Deploy to Render with proper environment variables
- Benefit from integrated logging and monitoring

**Option 2: Direct Server Deployment**
- Deploy to a VPS or dedicated server
- Use Docker containerization for consistency
- Implement proper reverse proxy with Nginx

**Option 3: AWS Production Deployment**
- Follow the comprehensive AWS deployment plan
- Use Elastic Beanstalk or ECS for container orchestration
- Implement full production infrastructure with RDS PostgreSQL
